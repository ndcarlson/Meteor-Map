        <h2>About the Meteorite Landings Dataset</h2>
        
		<p>Our dataset on meteorite landings is taken from NASA's records, it is a collection of data that goes over the details of all the meteorite falls and discoveries across the globe. It includes key attributes like the meteorite's name, classification, mass, fall status, year of discovery, and precise geographical coordinates. This dataset is not only seen as a meteorite classification chart, but as a time capsule which shows us an interesting look into our earth’s past.</p>

        <p>We chose to make an interactive map for this dataset because we are all very intrigued by space, and to be able to visualize something that so many people are fascinated by, in a way that isn’t available on the internet seemed like a fun challenge. With this map, people can explore the geographical spread of meteorite landings, see patterns in their distribution, and even see the details of each meteorite, such as its mass or classification. This form of visualization makes the data accessible and engaging, allowing anyone, regardless of their scientific background, to explore and learn about them. Our goal was to take a dataset that was hard to read and visualize and make it easier for anyone interested.</p>

    Below is the cleaned and geocoded dataset that we used for our project. To see the original dataset from NASA, please visit:
